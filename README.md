# CyberArk_EPM_Postman_Collection
The CyberArk Endpoint Privilege Manager Web Services enable you to automate tasks that are usually performed manually in the EPM console.

## SDK Supported Platforms
The EPM Web Services SDK is a RESTful API that can be invoked by any RESTful client for various programming and scripting environments, including Java, C#, Perl, PHP, Python and Ruby.

## Using the EPM Web Services SDK
The EPM Web Services SDK enables you to perform activities on EPM objects via a REST Web Service interface. Each EPM object has its own URL path in the EPM website that can be accessed using the relevant HTTP/S request verb.

**22 Aug, 2019** - Reformatting the collection
